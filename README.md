- A python Script to calculate and Perform Arithmetic
   Operations.

- Caution:- This software just part of my python course,so some errors are expected as i am a total beginner.

## Features

- Lets you perform Mathermatical calculations with ease.
- Very lightweight tool(only 300kb).
- Is made 100% in Python. 
- Many features will be added soon making it more useful.
- Easy to use.

## Requirements:

 - Python 3.12 or Above installed
 - An IDE (Not compulsory)

## Module Information:


- This suite includes a calculator written in python which supports basic arithmetic operators such as:
              
             > Division(used with the "/" operator).

             > Multiplication(used with the "*" operator). 

             > Sum(used with the "+" operator).
              
            > Subtraction(used with the "-" operator).

                1)A tool for finding are of rectangle(area_rectangle). 
                2)A tool for finding area of triangle(area_triangle).
                3)a tool for finding the area of circle(area_circle).

- This suite also has a Arithmetic Progression calculator built in so you can perform hefty calculations on the go!

## To-Do's:

- Compile it into an exe so it can run without interpreter(better compatibility)

- Add a Module to find out Simple and Compound Interest.

- Add more to-do's
