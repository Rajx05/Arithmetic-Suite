# Arithmetic-Suite

### A Python Script to calculate and Perform Arithmetic Operations with ease.

## Features

- Lets you perform Mathermatical calculations with ease.
- Very lightweight tool(only 300kb,but the exe file is nearly 7 MB which is not much).
- Is made 100% in Python. 
- Many features will be added soon making it more useful.
- Easy to use.
